# ASHRAE - Great Energy Predictor III
## How much energy will a building consume?

Q: How much does it cost to cool a skyscraper in the summer?
A: A lot! And not just in dollars, but in environmental impact.

Thankfully, significant investments are being made to improve building efficiencies to reduce costs and emissions. 
The question is, are the improvements working? That’s where you come in. 

Under pay-for-performance financing, the building owner makes payments based on the difference between their real energy consumption and what they would have used without any retrofits. 
The latter values have to come from a model. Current methods of estimation are fragmented and do not scale well. Some assume a specific meter type or don’t work with different building types.

In this competition, you’ll develop accurate models of metered building energy usage in the following areas: chilled water, electric, hot water, and steam meters. 
The data comes from over 1,000 buildings over a three-year timeframe. With better estimates of these energy-saving investments, large scale investors and financial institutions will be more inclined to invest in this area to enable progress in building efficiencies.

## Data
Assessing the value of energy efficiency improvements can be challenging as there's no way to truly know how much energy a building would have used without the improvements. The best we can do is to build counterfactual models. Once a building is overhauled the new (lower) energy consumption is compared against modeled values for the original building to calculate the savings from the retrofit. More accurate models could support better market incentives and enable lower cost financing.

This competition challenges you to build these counterfactual models across four energy types based on historic usage rates and observed weather. The dataset includes three years of hourly meter readings from over one thousand buildings at several different sites around the world.
